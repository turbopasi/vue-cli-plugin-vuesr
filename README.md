# vuesr
This project originated from using `@vue/cli` starter template. Its goal is to give a starting point for web apps which requires a simple user/admin dashboard frontend. I made it mainly for myself since I don't want to start from scratch everytime. It will include a login/sign-up view, a mainmenu-sidebar, a topbar, content-containers and a modal system. It also includes `vue-router` and `vuex` for navigation and store management. The project also already includes `bulma/buefy` css framework but I did not include any samples on how one might use any of its ready to use components (like forms or lists). It's basically the skeleton for a user/admin dashboard. How you use it, how you plan to implement authentication, how you plan to implement a database or any API is up to you entirely. Have fun ‚ù§
